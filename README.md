Exploring the ideological and memetic structure of political parties




Looking to explore the ideological and memetic structure of political parties. Specifically, the initial data exploration will begin with collecting and analyzing data from the Manifesto Project Database (https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/) to allow for cross-world/cross-time comparisons. Codebook for Manifesto Project can be found here (https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/down/data/2020b/codebooks/codebook_MPDataset_MPDS2020b.pdf)

The initial thrust behind this research is to try to identify core or root ideas at the center of party families to see certain traits (almost like genes- or in this case "memes", in the information theory sense) form networks or "genomes" of overlapping ideas that form a strong basis for a party identity that will likely show evolution over time as cultural and world events change.

The beginning focus of this research will focus mostly on nationalist and authoritarian parties due to personal interest and an existing personal knowledge base. Part of this initial exploration will also seek to investigate how parties that score high in these authoritarian issues/identity seek to interact with sections of the voting population that exhibit an affinity for authoritarian political parties. This will hopefully provide interesting insights into how 1) the genomes of parties develop 2) how these parties seek to interact with and maximize support from their prospective constituencies 3) how interactions between elites and populace influence the development of the party genome/memetic structure

Note: Research design is in development and this description will likely see developments as project progresses
